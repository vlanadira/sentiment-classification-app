## Welcome to the Steam Review Sentiment Analysis project!

This repository contains the complete implementation of my undergraduate thesis: **"IMPLEMENTATION OF CRISP-DM FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON STEAM GAME REVIEWS"**,
designed to classify Steam game reviews into Positive or Negative sentiments. The project utilizes the CRISP-DM methodology and compares four Deep Learning architectures (LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU) with various imbalance handling techniques. The final deployed model uses BiLSTM with Class Weighting for optimal performance.
